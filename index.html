            Gittr is a web app that enables local-level couriers to facilitate
            online ordering for their partnered restaurants. Gittr helps courier
            companies manage business-to-business relationships and last mile
            delivery services with partners. Gittr provides a web interface for
            end users to order and pay online, dispatching the order to the
            courier company and the product provider simultaneously. The courier
            company then picks up the order from the partnered business and
            delivers it.

            Gittr presents a way for local level courier companies (represented
            by Admin Users) to enable online ordering for their partnered merchants
            (represented by Merchant Users). Gittr accepts and processes
            payment from the customer (represented by End Users), takes out an
            application fee, and deposits the money in company's account. The
            merchant and company are notified about the order and the merchant
            prepares the order for pickup by the company. The company then completes
            delivery.<br />

            The Dashboard holds a snapshot of what's currently going on with
            your company. There are two collapsible items - Active Orders and
            Today's Sales. Clicking the "Active Orders" dropdown will show you a
            list of currently active orders with the option to view them.
            Clicking the "Today's Sales" dropdown will give you an overview of
            the day's activity in real numbers, including an order count,
            generated revenue, payouts, and profits.

            All of your company's orders will appear on this screen, separated
            into four categories:<br />
            <strong>New, Active, Completed,</strong> and <strong>Refunded</strong>.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            <strong>New</strong> orders are orders that have been received and
            paid for but have not yet accepted by the merchant or your company.
            Accepting the order by clicking "Accept" under "actions" will move
            the order to the "active" category. Orders can be accepted by
            merchants or company administrators. Declining the order by clicking
            "Decline" under "actions" will move the order to the "refunded"
            category and the order will be refunded to the customer.<br />
            When an order is received, three emails are sent out: one to your
            company, one to the merchant to notify them, and one to the
            customer as a receipt. The merchant has the option from their email
            alert to accept or decline the order. Once the merchant has accepted
            or declined an order, there is nothing you need to do further (except
            complete the delivery, of course!).<br />
            If your company does not enable TwinJet, the order status can be
            changed from this screen. To change an order's status, click the
            "status" drop down on the order. Select the status ("cancelled",
            "ready", "picked up", or "delivered") to change it to. The status
            will automatically update once a status is selected.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Active</strong> orders are orders that have been received,
            paid for, dispatched to TwinJet, and accepted by the merchant or
            company. Orders in this category are somewhere between getting
            dispatched and getting to the customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Completed</strong> orders are orders that have been delivered
            to the customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Refunded</strong> orders have been declined or refunded to
            the customer. These orders will still be available for reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cancelled</strong> order have been cancelled due to a reason
            beyond control of the company. Various reasons for cancelled orders
            include a customer cancelling the order, a merchant cancelling the
            order due to product shortage, or a company cancelling an order
            because it was undeliverable.

            The Dashboard holds a snapshot of what's currently going on with the
            logged-in merchant. There are two collapsible items - Active Orders
            and Sales Summary. Clicking the "Active Orders" dropdown will show a
            list of currently active orders with the option to view them.
            Clicking the "Sales Summary" dropdown will show an overview of the
            day's activity in real numbers, including an order count, generated
            revenue, payouts, and profits.

            All of the merchant's orders will appear on this screen, separated
            into four categories:<br />
            <strong>New, Active, Completed,</strong> and <strong>Refunded.</strong>
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p>
            <strong>New</strong> orders are orders that have been received and
            paid for, but have not yet accepted by the merchant or company.
            Accepting the order by clicking "Accept" under "actions" will move
            the order to the "active" category. Orders can be accepted by
            merchants or company administrators. Declining the order by clicking
            "Decline" under "actions" will move the order to the "refunded"
            category and the order will be refunded to the customer. <br />
            When an order is received, three emails are sent out: one to the
            company, one to the merchant to notify them, and one to the customer
            as a receipt. The merchant has the option from their email alert to
            accept or decline the order. Once the order has been accepted or
            declined, there is nothing futher to do (except make the order, of
            course!).<br />
            <strong>Completed</strong> orders are orders that have been
            delivered to the customer.<br />
            <strong>Refunded</strong> orders have been declined or refunded to the customer.
            These orders will still be available for reference.<br />
            <strong>Cancelled</strong> orders have been cancelled by the courier
            company.

            Menus are the heart of any merchant. They are broken down in a
            hierarchy of data points, each with a parent. The hierarchy looks

            Menus contain all of the categories, items, subcategories, subitems,
            item options, and item sizes available from a merchant. In addition
            to those items, they also have specific characteristics, including
            the timeframe the menu is served and the menu's name, description,
            status, and type (wholesale or not).

            In the menu editor, you can change the menu's name and description,
            bring up the serving time editor, delete serving times, manage the
            status and menu options.

            'add' (<i class='material-icons inline'>add</i>) button in the row of the menu
            you want the timeframe added to. Clicking this button will bring up

          <h5>Changing Menu Status</h5>
          <p>
            A menu's status determines whether to show the menu or not. The

            while a status of "unpublished" will not.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h5>Catering and Wholesale</h5>
          <p>
            When building a catering menu, select the "catering" option. This
            will inform the courier company that the items will be larger and
            require different equipment than when an order is placed from a
            regular menu.<br />
            Setting a menu as wholesale will limit the menu's display to partnered
            wholesale clients. Similarly to a catering menu, orders placed from
            a wholesale menu will also inform the courier company that the items
            will be larger and require special equipment to transport the items.
          </p>

            (<i class='material-icons inline'>mode_edit</i>) to open the category editor.<br />
            The categories list is sortable and filterable. To sort the list by

          <p>
            At the third level of menu organization are <strong>items</strong>.
            An item is a product that's available to be purchased, can have
            subcategories assigned to it, and is itself assigned to a menu category.<br />
            Items have a few main characteristics: menu &amp; category assignment,
            name, description, and photo. Optional characteristics include assigned
            subcategories, default price, and sizes. To view, edit, add, and delete
            items, click the "menu" drop-down item in the navigation panel, then
            click "items".<br />
            The items list is sortable and filterable. To sort by name, price,
            or category, click the column header. To reverse sort by name, price,
            or category, click the column header again. <br />
            To find a specific item by name or category, type the keyword in the
            "filter" text box in the top right corner of the table. The items
            list will automatically filter out non-matching items as the keyword
            is typed.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h5>Creating an Item</h5>

            To edit an item, click the item's "edit" (<i class='material-icons inline'>mode_edit</i>)
            button. In the item editor, menu and category assignment can be

            description can be edited, a new photo can be uploaded, the item's
            photo can be deleted, the default price can be changed, and the
            item's sizes can be viewed, selected for editing or deleted.<br />
            The item editor enables subcategories to be assigned to items. To
            assign a subcategory to an item, click the checkbox next to the
            subcategory name to be assigned. <br />
            To delete the item, click "delete item" at the bottom of the item
            editor. Deleting an item will not delete it's subcategories or subitems,
            just the association.<br />
            Changing the status of an item from "published" to "unpublished" will
            hide it from the menu's view without deleting the item. This toggle
            is useful when a merchant temporarily goes out of stock on an item
            and won't be able to continue to fulfill orders for this item. Once
            the item returns to stock, the status can be updated to "published".
